## The Astrology System

Character creation uses your **Sun**, **Moon**, and **Rising** signs to generate unique stats:

- **Sun sign** sets your core archetype and base stats
- **Moon sign** determines your Nakshatra (lunar mansion) which grants a passive ability
- **Rising sign** controls your Decan modifier affecting world generation

Two zodiac forms — **AIRES [FIRE]** (fast, aggressive) and **KOIDON [WATER]** (floaty, double jump) — can be switched mid-combat.

## Chakra Worlds

Progress through 7 worlds, each tied to a chakra. Defeat the boss to unlock that chakra's power:

1. **Root** (Muladhara) — Grounding Slam
2. **Sacral** (Svadhisthana) — Flow Surge
3. **Solar Plexus** (Manipura) — Radiant Shield
4. **Heart** (Anahata) — Harmonic Heal
5. **Throat** (Vishuddha) — Resonance Wave
6. **Third Eye** (Ajna) — Astral Sight
7. **Crown** (Sahasrara) — Cosmic Alignment
